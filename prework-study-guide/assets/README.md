# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## This includes basics in HTML, CSS, javasctipt, and Git.


As a boot camp student my motivation was to create a study gudie that put my notes in for each of these web page structures. I built this project to practice using some of these basics and to have a foundation to start the boot camp course. It solves the problems of how to set up git hub commits and practice using VS code. I learned how to use a terminal to navigate files, I learned how to create git branches.

Badges aren't necessary, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.
